![FINS](./docs/fins-logo.png "Firmware IP Node Specification")

Firmware Intellectual Property (IP) Node Specification (FINS) is an innovative software tool chain from Geon Technologies that defines a programmable logic processing module and automates the firmware design, verification, and integration workflows. The foundation of FINS is the definition of a modular IP (intellectual property) node with a human-readable JSON schema. The schema specification is the launching point for code generators to accelerate embedded systems development. Programmable logic development is automated for the following areas:

1. **IP Build and Simulation Workflows.** TCL and Makefile scripts generated by FINS automate the build and simulation of IP. IP modules can be built for compatibility with Xilinx Vivado IP Integrator or Intel Quartus Platform Designer which enables rapid insertion of IP in platform code and vendor reference designs.
2. **Rapid Reconfiguration.** FINS consolidates parameterization of IP into a single location and distributes these parameters across design tools with code generation of header-like package files.
3. **Properties and Ports Interfaces.** FINS generates HDL source code for a properties interface that enables repeatable software control of firmware and for a ports interface that standardizes firmware to firmware movement of data.

## Prerequisites

The software packages required to use FINS are:

* Xilinx Vivado (Tested with 2019.1) and/or Intel Quartus Prime Pro (Tested with 19.1)
* GNU Make
* Python 3.6 with setuptools 41.2.0
* Jinja2
* \[Optional\] GNU Octave and/or Mathworks MATLAB

## Installation

Run the following commands from the root of this repository to install the FINS Python package:

> NOTE: You may need to upgrade your version of pip and setuptools before installing FINS. To perform this upgrade, execute the command: `sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools`.

```bash
# Install the FINS software and "core" generator
$ python3 -m pip install .
# Install the "vivado" generator plugin
$ python3 -m pip install ./vivado
# Install the "quartus" generator plugin
$ python3 -m pip install ./quartus
```
> NOTE: You may not have permissions to run these `python3 -m pip` commands. To resolve this you can either use a python virtual environment, the `--user` option (`python3 -m pip --user`), or `sudo`.

To uninstall FINS, run the following commands:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip uninstall fins fins-quartus fins-vivado
```
> NOTE: Again, you may not have permissions to run these `python3 -m pip` commands. To resolve this you can either use a python virtual environment, the `--user` option (`python3 -m pip --user`), or `sudo`.

To verify your installation and run an example of a FINS Node, execute the following commands to build and simulate the test IP with Vivado:

> NOTE: Make sure you have sourced the Xilinx "settings64.sh" script for the version of Vivado you are using. This test requires GNU Octave or Mathworks MATLAB.

```bash
# Enter the test IP directory
$ cd ./test/node/
# Run the fins executable to generate the Vivado backend
$ fins -b vivado zynq.json
# Run the simulation in command line mode
$ make sim
```

The log files below contain the details of operations in the FINS execution process:

* **./test/node/log/ip_create.log**: This log file contains the details of each step executed to build the "test_top" IP.
* **./test/node/log/ip_simulate.log**: This log file contains the details of each step executed to simulate the "test_top" IP.

## Learning FINS

A FINS "Node" is a single modular, resuable firmware Intellectual Property (IP). A Node serves as the foundation of FINS. See the link below for more information on development of a "Node".

* [Node Development](./docs/development.md)

To follow a tutorial on how to create a simple "power_converter" FINS Node, see the link below.

* [Power Converter Tutorial](docs/tutorial1.md)

See the links below for detailed documentation on elements of a FINS Node.

* [Node Parameters](./docs/parameters.md)
* [Node Properties](./docs/properties.md)
* [Node Ports](./docs/ports.md)
* [Node Filesets](./docs/filesets.md)
* [Node Sub-IP](./docs/sub-ip.md)

A FINS "Nodeset" is the collection of FINS Nodes that exist within a programmable logic build. See the link below for more information on integrating a FINS "Nodeset".

* [Nodeset Integration](./docs/integration.md)

## Notes

Here are few things to keep in mind when developing FINS IP:

* Xilinx's AXI Interconnect only supports 32bit data widths for AXI4-Lite, but Intel's AXI Interconnect supports both 32bit and 64bit data widths of the AXI4-Lite standard.
* Xilinx's AXI Interconnect creates slave AXI4-Lite byte-indexed buses, whereas Intel's AXI Interconnect creates slave AXI4-Lite word-indexed buses.
* FINS currently generates only VHDL for all HDL code. Verilog user code may require a translation layer of properties and ports records.
* When switching between vendors, you will need to change the part specified in the FINS Node JSON file. You may also find it convenient to specify a top-level FINS parameter to define the vendor that can be used in the HDL in "generate" statements.
* The "quartus" backend does not support a Verilog file as its top-level source file.
* No directory paths should have spaces. For example, `/home/user/Documents/project 1/` is invalid.

The AXI4-Lite buses and AXI4-Stream buses used in the top-level source file have strict requirements for their signals used and their naming. Every bus must have both clock and reset with signal names `aclk` and `aresetn`, respectively. The naming conventions are listed below.

* AXI4-Lite: `["m" or "s"][OPTIONAL_DECIMAL_NUMBER]_axi_[OPTIONAL_BUS_NAME]_[SIGNAL_NAME]`
* AXI4-Stream: `["m" or "s"][OPTIONAL_DECIMAL_NUMBER]_axis_[PORT_NAME]_[SIGNAL_NAME]`

## Contributing to FINS

To develop FINS templates or Python code, it is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment with an "editable" install:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -e .
$ pip3 install -e ./vivado
$ pip3 install -e ./quartus
```
> NOTE: You may not have permissions to run the first `pip3` command here. To resolve this you can use the `--user` option or `sudo`.

Any new code must be able to build and simulate the test IP for both Vivado and Quartus. To run both tests, execute the following commands:

> NOTE: These tests require both Octave and MATLAB. Make sure Quartus is in your `$PATH` environmental variable and the Vivado "settings64.sh" script is sourced!

```bash
$ cd ./test/node/
$ fins -b vivado zynq.json
$ make sim
$ make clean-all
$ fins -b quartus cycloneV.json
$ make sim
```

New code must also be able to parse FINS Nodeset JSON files. To run the nodeset test, execute the following commands:

```bash
$ cd ./test/nodeset/
$ fins nodeset.json
```
