# FINS Integration: Applications and Systems

**[RETURN TO TOP LEVEL README](../README.md)**

Integration in FINS involves three separate steps:
1. [**Application Development**](applications.md): Instantiate and connect FINS Nodes in a FINS Application JSON file
2. **Application-Platform Integration**: Integrate an Application with a PL Platform (often vendor-provided) to create a complete programmable-logic design
2. [**System Development**](systems.md): Describe a completed programmable-logic design's contents in a FINS System JSON file. This will be used by the FINS Software Package for simple access to FINS Nodes

In short, a user will construct a FINS Application comprised of FINS Nodes, and will then integrate this Application into a (often vendor-provided) platform. Once the programmable-logic design is complete, the user will create a FINS System to describe the design's contents and interfaces for use by the FINS Software Package. Below is an example of a FINS System:
