# FINS Node Filesets

**[RETURN TO TOP LEVEL README](../README.md)**

Filesets are the way that files are categorized and used within a programmable logic IP core. FINS uses the references to these files to automating the IP creation process by code generating vendor IP creation and simulation scripts.

## JSON Schema

The top-level `filesets` field of the FINS Node JSON schema is a dictionary which contains a field for each category of files. Each category in turn has sub-fields for defining the files and their types as described in the table below.

> NOTES: Code that is generated by FINS (package files, properties decode module, etc.) must be added to the filesets references in FINS. Don't worry, FINS will perform the code generation before checking that they exist! The indentations indicate another level of hierarchy for the dictionary. For example, the `type` and `path` keys are child fields of the `source` key.

| Key                                                   | Type    | Required | Value Restrictions          | Description |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| source                                                | dict[]  | NO       |                             | An array of synthesizable HDL source file definitions. The top-level source filename without the extension **MUST** match the FINS Node JSON schema `top_source` field. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-type                         | string  | NO       | vhdl, verilog               | The language of the HDL source file. If not set, the language is auto-detected based on file extension (".v"=verilog, ".vhd"=vhdl). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-path                         | string  | YES      |                             | The relative filepath of the source file. |
| sim                                                   | dict[]  | NO       |                             | An array of testbench HDL simulation file definitions. The top-level testbench filename without the extension **MUST** match the FINS Node JSON schema `top_sim` field. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-type                         | string  | NO       | vhdl, verilog               | The language of the HDL simulation file. If not set, the language is auto-detected based on file extension (".v"=verilog, ".vhd"=vhdl). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-path                         | string  | YES      |                             | The relative filepath of the simulation file. |
| constraints                                           | dict[]  | NO       |                             | An array of constraints file definitions. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-type                         | string  | NO       | xdc, sdc                    | The language of the constraints file. Vivado uses "xdc" files and Quartus uses "sdc" files. The auto-generated IP creation scripts for each vendor will only use the type that it supports. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-vendor_ip                    | dict[]  | NO       |                             | An array of vendor IP script definitions. These are scripts that use vendor tool functions to create and parameterize IP cores. |

These are scripts executed by Python, Matlab, Octave, or vendor tools before the simulation is run. An example usage is creating simulation input files. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+type | string  | NO       | matlab, octave, python, tcl | The language of the pre-simulation script file. If not set, the language is auto-detected based on file extension (".m"=octave, ".py"=python, ".tcl"=tcl). Octave is run for files of type "matlab" when MATLAB is not available. |

These are scripts executed by Python, Matlab, Octave, or vendor tools after the simulation is run. An example usage is verifying simulation output files. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+type | string  | NO       | matlab, octave, python, tcl | The language of the post-simulation script file. If not set, the language is auto-detected based on file extension (".m"=octave, ".py"=python, ".tcl"=tcl). Octave is run for files of type "matlab" when MATLAB is not available. |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+type | string  | NO       | matlab, octave, python, tcl | The language of the pre-build script file. If not set, the language is auto-detected based on file extension (".m"=octave, ".py"=python, ".tcl"=tcl). Octave is run for files of type "matlab" when MATLAB is not available. |

## Code Generation

The `filesets` definition permit the code generation of the IP build scripts.

For the `vivado` backend:

* **Makefile**: This makefile runs the build and simulation of the IP. All non-TCL `scripts` are executed by this script.
* **ip_create.tcl**: This script builds and packages the IP. The `source`, `sim`, and `constraints` filesets are added to the IP project. The `prebuild` and `postbuild` TCL scripts are sourced at the beginning and end of this script, respectively; the `vendor_ip` scripts are sourced to create vendor IP.
* **ip_simulate.tcl**: This script runs the simulation for the IP. The `presim` and `postsim` TCL scripts are sourced at the beginning and end of this script, respectively.

For the `quartus` backend:

* **Makefile**: This makefile runs the build and simulation of the IP. All non-TCL `scripts` are executed by this script.
* **ip_create.tcl**: This script builds the packaged IP. The `source`, `sim`, and `constraints` filesets are added to the IP project. The `prebuild` and `postbuild` TCL scripts are sourced at the beginning and end of this script, respectively.
* **ip_hw.tcl**: This script represents the packaged IP. The `vendor_ip` scripts are sourced in the "elaboration" callback to create vendor IP.
* **ip_simulate.tcl**: This script runs the simulation for the IP. The `presim` and `postsim` TCL scripts are sourced at the beginning and end of this script, respectively.
