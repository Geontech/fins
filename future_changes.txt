Possible Changes:
- Add verification that "IP_NAME" is filled out before allowing user to save
- Checking that parameters given for values of other parameters have matching types
- In drop-down menus containing parameter names, remove names that are not of the proper type (ie. a "string" parameter when a "boolean" is required)
- Format booleans to always be lowercase when saving
- IP Page:
    * Allow users to add new child parameters 
    * Save list of parameters from the sub-IP to use in a dropdown menu (similar to Parent)
    * May be an issue with finding common path if an IP has not been selected already
- Filesets:
    * Display temp in a way that let's users have some control

- Add more error/update messages to the log to help with debugging
- Add FAQ and help menu so the GUI is more self-explanatory
- Make it generally prettier
